# Subscribing to Products<a name="buyer-subscribing-to-products"></a>

 Subscribing to a product means that you have accepted the terms of the product as shown on the product’s listing page, including pricing terms and the software seller’s end user license agreement \(EULA\), and that you agree to use such product in accordance with the [AWS Customer Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/)\. 

 If the product has a monthly fee or is purchased with a subscription contract, then you will be charged the fee upon subscription, prorated based on the time remaining in the month\. No other charges will be assessed until you launch an Amazon EC2 instance with the product AMI, deploy the product using an AWS CloudFormation template, or register and begin using the SaaS product on the vendors website\. 

 If the product has an annual subscription option, then you will be charged the full annual fee upon subscription\. This charge will cover product usage base, with subscription renewal due on the anniversary of the original subscription date\. At the end of the annual subscription period, if you do not renew the annual subscription, it will convert to an hourly subscription at the then current hourly rate\.
