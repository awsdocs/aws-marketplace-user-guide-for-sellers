# What Is AWS Marketplace?<a name="what-is-marketplace"></a>

AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog customers can use to find, buy, deploy, and manage third\-party software, data, and services that customers need to build solutions and run their businesses\. AWS Marketplace includes thousands of software listings from popular categories such as security, networking, storage, machine learning, business intelligence, database, and DevOps\. AWS Marketplace also simplifies software licensing and procurement with flexible pricing options and multiple deployment methods\. In addition, AWS Marketplace includes data products available from AWS Data Exchange\.

Customers can quickly launch preconfigured software with just a few clicks, and choose software solutions in Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\), software as a service \(SaaS\), and other formats\. You can browse and subscribe to data products\. Flexible pricing options include free trial, hourly, monthly, annual, multi\-year, and BYOL, and get billed from one source\. AWS handles billing and payments, and charges appear on customers’ AWS bill\.

 You can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer \(subscriber\), seller \(provider\), or both\. Anyone with an AWS account can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer, and can register to become a seller\. A seller can be an independent software vendor \(ISV\), value\-added reseller, or individual who has something to offer that works with AWS products and services\. 

**Note**  
Data product providers must meet the AWS Data Exchange eligibility requirements\. For more information, see [Providing Data Products on AWS Data Exchange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/providing-data-sets.html) in the *AWS Data Exchange User Guide*\.

Every software product on AWS Marketplace has been through a curation process\. On the product page, there can be one or more offerings for the product\. When the seller submits a product in AWS Marketplace, they define the price of the product and the terms and conditions of use\. When a consumer subscribes to a product offering, they agree to the pricing and terms and conditions set for the offer\. 

 The product can be free to use or it can have an associated charge\. The charge becomes part of your AWS bill, and after you pay, AWS Marketplace pays the seller\. Products can take many forms\. For example, a product can be offered as an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) that is instantiated using your AWS account\. The product can also be configured to use AWS CloudFormation templates for delivery to the consumer\. The product can also be software as a service \(SaaS\) offerings from an ISV, web ACL, set of rules, or conditions for AWS WAF\. 

Software products can be purchased at the listed price using the ISV’s standard end user license agreement \(EULA\) or offered with customer pricing and EULA\. Products can also be purchased under a contract with specified time or usage boundaries\. After the product subscriptions are in place, the consumer can copy the product to their AWS Service Catalog to manage how the product is accessed and used in the consumer’s organization\. 

## Using AWS Marketplace as a seller<a name="using-aws-marketplace-as-a-provider"></a>

 As a seller, go to the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management) to register\. If you're providing a data product or you're charging for use of your software product, you must also provide tax and banking information as part of your registration\. When you register, you create a profile for your company or for yourself that is discoverable on AWS Marketplace\. You also use the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management) to create and manage product pages for your products\.

Eligible partners can programmatically list AWS Marketplace products outside of AWS Marketplace\. For information about becoming an eligible partner, contact your AWS Marketplace business development partner\.
