# AWS Marketplace Field Demonstration Program<a name="field-demonstration-program"></a>

The AWS Marketplace Field Demonstration Program \(FDP\) allows the AWS field team \(internally approved AWS employees\) to use some  products and solutions through AWS Marketplace at no charge\.

Examples of approved AWS employees may include solutions architects and sales and marketing professionals\. The FDP allows these employees to demonstrate product capabilities for education and potential inclusion in customer workloads\.

The following product types are supported:
+ [Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\)](ami-products.md) 
+ [Containers](container-based-products.md) 
+ [Machine learning algorithms and model packages \(SageMaker\)](machine-learning-products.md) 
+ [Datasets \(AWS Data Exchange\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/what-is.html)
**Note**  
For AWS Data Exchange products, the FDP only applies to products with a public offer of $0 \(free\)\.  
For AWS Data Exchange products that have subscription verification enabled, providers need to approve the subscription request\. For more information about subscription verification, see [Subscription verification for subscribers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/subscription-verification-sub.html) in the *AWS Data Exchange User Guide*\.

You're automatically enrolled in the FDP program when you sign up as an AWS Marketplace seller\. To opt out, submit a support request to the [Managed Catalog Operations \(MCO\) team](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/)\.
