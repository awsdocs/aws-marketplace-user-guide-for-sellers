# Professional services products<a name="proserv-products"></a>

 As a seller, you can offer professional services to AWS Marketplace buyers\. Professional services include services to assess, migrate, support, manage, and train others in how to use products in AWS Marketplace\. Sellers create a product offering that describes the services they provide, negotiate with customers to create an agreement on terms, and then create a custom offer for services through AWS Marketplace\. 

 AWS customers can find professional services products searching by category, by seller, and alongside the AWS Marketplace products they are already purchasing\. They are charged for the services in their AWS bill and can use tools such as AWS Cost Explorer to centralize payments and manage their costs\.
