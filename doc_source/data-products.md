AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to securely exchange file\-based data sets in the AWS Cloud\. As a provider, AWS Data Exchange eliminates the need to build and maintain any data delivery, entitlement, or billing technology\. Providers in AWS Data Exchange have a secure, transparent, and reliable channel to reach AWS customers and grant existing customers their subscriptions more efficiently\. The process for becoming an AWS Data Exchange provider requires a few steps to determine eligibility\.

A data product has the following parts:
+ **Product details** – This information helps potential subscribers understand what the product is\. This includes a name, descriptions \(both short and long\), a logo image, and support contact information\. Product details are filled out by providers\.
+ **Product offer\(s\)** – In order to make a product available on AWS Data Exchange, providers must define a public offer\. This includes the prices and durations, data subscription agreement, refund policy, and the option to create custom offers\.
+ **Data set\(s\)** – A product can contain one or more data sets\. A data set is a dynamic set of file\-based data content\. Data sets are dynamic and are versioned using revisions\. Each revision can contain multiple assets\.
