# Software and services on AWS Marketplace<a name="buyer-software-and-services"></a>

 AWS Marketplace features many software categories including databases, application servers, testing tools, monitoring tools, content management, and business intelligence\. You can select commercial software from well\-known sellers, as well as many widely used open source offerings\. When you find products you want, you can buy and deploy that software to your own Amazon EC2 instance with 1\-Click\. You can also leverage AWS CloudFormation to deploy a topology of the product\. 

Any AWS customer can shop on AWS Marketplace\. Software prices and estimated infrastructure prices are displayed on the website\. You can purchase most software immediately, using payment instruments already on file with AWS\. Software charges appear on the same monthly bill as AWS infrastructure charges\. 

**Notes**  
There are many business products available in the AWS Marketplace, including both software\-as\-a\-service \(SaaS\) and server\-based products\. The server\-based products might require technical knowledge or IT support to set up and maintain\.

## Differences between AWS Marketplace and Amazon DevPay<a name="how-is-aws-marketplace-different-from-devpay"></a>

There are substantial differences between AWS Marketplace and Amazon DevPay\. Both help customers buy software that runs on AWS, but AWS Marketplace offers a more comprehensive experience\. For software buyers, the key differences are the following: 
+  AWS Marketplace offers a shopping experience more like Amazon\.com, simplifying discovery of available software\. 
+  AWS Marketplace products work with other AWS features such as VPC and can be run on Reserved and Spot Instances, in addition to normal On\-Demand Instances\. 
+  AWS Marketplace supports software backed by Amazon Elastic Block Store, and DevPay does not\.

 Additionally, software sellers benefit from the marketing outreach and ease of discovery of AWS Marketplace\.
