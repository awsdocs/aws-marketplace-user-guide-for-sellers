# Requirements for professional services products<a name="proserv-product-guidelines"></a>

AWS Marketplace maintains requirements for all products and offerings on AWS Marketplace\. These requirements help to promote a safe, secure, and trustworthy curated digital catalog for our customers\. We encourage sellers to review the implementation of additional controls and protocols as applicable to meet the needs of their specific products\.

AWS Marketplace reviews all products and their related metadata when submitted to ensure that they meet or exceed current AWS Marketplace requirements\. We review and adjust these requirements to meet our security requirements\. In addition, AWS Marketplace continuously reviews products to verify that they meet any changes to these requirements\. If products fall out of compliance, AWS Marketplace contacts you to update your product\. In some cases, your products might temporarily be unavailable to new subscribers until issues are resolved\.

+ All pricing dimensions must relate to actual services offered and billed using AWS Marketplace\.
+ Your products must be listed in one of these categories: *Assessments*, *Implementation*, *Managed services*, *Premium support*, or *Training*\.

## Product usage guidelines<a name="proserv-guidelines-usage"></a>

All professional services products must adhere to the following product usage guidelines:
+ After subscribing to the product in AWS Marketplace, customers should be able to access the service or be contacted by you \(as the seller\) within two business days of subscription\. If the customer can't gain access to the service immediately, you must send an email message to them with specific details about when they will gain access\. When the access is granted, you must send the customer an email message confirming that the access has been granted along with clear next steps\.

## Architecture guidelines<a name="proserv-guidelines-architecture"></a>

All professional services products must adhere to the following architecture guidelines:
+ Professional services products must be related to at least one public AWS Marketplace product \(up to four\) in which the product offers services for those related products directly or offers services that drive more subscribers to that AWS Marketplace product\.
+ If the services offered require additional resources in the customer's infrastructure, follow these guidelines:
  + Provision resources in a secure way, such as by using the AWS Security Token Service or AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\.
  + Provide additional documentation including a description of all provisioned AWS services, IAM policy statements, and how an IAM role or user is deployed and used in the customer account\.
  + Include a notification in the product description that explains that if the customer incurs additional AWS infrastructure costs, separate from their AWS Marketplace transaction, they're responsible for paying additional infrastructure charges\.
  + If your product deploys an agent, provide instructions to the customer that describe how to deploy the agent in their AWS account\.
